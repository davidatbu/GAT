"""PyTest fixtures that are shared across tests files.

https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixture-functions

    "If during implementing your tests you realize that you want to use a fixture
     function from multiple test files you can move it to a conftest.py file. You donâ€™t
     need to import the fixture you want to use in a test, it automatically gets
     discovered by pytest. The discovery of fixture functions starts at test classes,
     then test modules, then conftest.py files and finally builtin and third party
     plugins."
